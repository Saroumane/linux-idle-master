VERSION 2.2 UPDATE

## REQUIREMENTS

The script needs these Python packages to run:
 * requests
 * beautifulsoup4
 * pillow (with jpeg and tk support)
 * colorama

Example for Arch:
`pacman -S python-beautifulsoup4 python-requests python-pillow python-colorama tk`

## SETUP
1. Log in to https://steamcommunity.com/
2. Search your cookies for steamcommunity.com (Firefox user can use Shift-F9 to inspect cookie data _Firefox v98.0 tested_)
3. Copy settings-template.txt and rename to settings.txt
4. Edit setting.txt and copy-paste sessionid Content (an alpha-numerical code) from cookie data to the first field
5. Copy steamLoginSecure Content (really long alpha-numerical code) from cookie into the second field in settings.txt
6. Save settings.txt and exit

>[!IMPORTANT]
>store.steampowered.com and steamcommunity.com use different cookie data, if you get the error `Invalid cookie data, cannot log into Steam` then make sure you are using the cookie data from steamcommunity.com and **NOT** store.steampowered.com.

>[!NOTE]
>Steam login session will only last ~24hrs or less and will generate a new code when you log back in. Follow the above steps to get a new code.

### _(optional)_ BLACKLISTING GAMES
1. Create a file called blacklist.txt in the same folder as the script
2. Add game ID, each game ID should be on a seperate line
3. Save blacklist.txt and exit

### _(optional)_ SORTING
Edit the setting.txt and in the sort field add the following

 * `mostcards`     (idles game with the most card drops remaining)
 * `leastcards`    (idles game with the least card drops remaining)
 * `mostvalue`     (idles game with the most expensive card drops remaining)
 * `leastvalue`    (idles game with the least expensive card drops remaining)

>[!NOTE]
>The old "Enhanced Steam" API was taken down but was revived by "IsThereAnyDeal" with a new browser extention and API, the new API is called "Augmented Steam". None of the APIs use user data but are only used to check the cards average price on steam market place and sort which games to idle appropriately.

### HOW TO RUN
1. open terminal and `cd` to idle master folder
2. `python ./start.py`

* While idling a game press `Ctrl-C` to access menu
  * q - Quit
